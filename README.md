# Hey there, I'm berryloop 👋

I'm Jona — soon-to-be CS Master's student and currently working in a technical role at a large company.  
Right now, I'm transitioning deeper into the world of software engineering: architecture, automation & testing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Languages & Logic**: Python, VBA, Power Platform, KNIME, BluePrism  
- **Dev Basics**: Git, GitHub/GitLab, Excel (yes, still)  
- **Currently Learning**: Testing, CI/CD, Software Architecture  

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Building a solid dev foundation while studying & working  
- Creating tools that automate, simplify, and scale internal processes  
- Learning by doing (and breaking things occasionally)  

## ☕ About Me
- Coffee enthusiast with a soft spot for good design
- Anime fan & tech aesthetic nerd    
- Always experimenting — sometimes it even works

> “Code is like coffee – better when fresh, clean, and slightly over-engineered.”
